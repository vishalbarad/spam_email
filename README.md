#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to detect whether mail sent by person is spam or not.

## Project Description
This is project based on classification ml algorithm. 

Dataset used by this project is 'spam.csv' downloaded from kaggle. After downloading and importing dataset(in jupyter Notebook) i did data mapping like ham=0 and spam=1 and created one column 'sapm'.

After that i just divided my dataset into dependent and independent features. (Independent features=Message | Dependent feature=Spam) and split into training and testing data.

After that i did text preprocessing for that i used 'CountVectorizer'.

After that i created 'Multinomial naive bayes' model and used pipline.

I got 97% testing accuracy.

After that i saved model using 'joblib' library. After that I creted UI in flask and deployed on 'Heroku'.
